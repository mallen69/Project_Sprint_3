# Descriptive Title for your Project (To learn how to take dirty data and make it tidy in order to work with it in R.)

**Author:** [Michael Allen]

__*Project Description:*__
**To utilize R to clean (real) Survey Monkey End of Course Survey Data (known as Dirty Data) for the time period of (February 2016 through August 2016) which has been exported to R. And then export it back to a CSV file.

*The original End of Course Survey Data is proprietary and will not be loaded into this repo*
Possibly a modified version will be mocked up and installed.  

*I hope to be able to use this code/concepts as I move further along in this program and outside of this program in the future*
