Title: To learn how to take dirty data and make it tidy in order to work with it in R.


Sprint 3 - To utilize R to clean (real) Survey Monkey End of Course Survey Data (known as Dirty Data) from the collection time period of (February 2016 through August 2016) which has been exported to R. And then export (write) it back to a CSV file.


As a Technology Teacher I need to learn how to take dirty data (From Excel during this Sprint) and make it tidy in order to eventually perform statistical analysis with it in R. I hope to be able to use this code/concepts as I move further along in this program and also outside of this program in the future.


Exported Real End of Sprint Survey Data from the dates of February 2016 thru August 2016 to Excel.  Set the proper working directory in R, read in the Exported Excel "Dirty Data" into R, collapsed the multiple column names that Survey Monkey created for Instructor into one Instuctor Column name with the "Paste" command, renamed the long Column names with the names command, deleted the extra columns added by Survey Monkey with the subset command, and then exported the R Tidy Data back to a clean CSV file with the write.csv command. All of this was created in an R Script titled Cleaning_the_Excel_Dirty_Data.R
